## Motivational Letter

> Team: User Experience

A whole team!

> **_User Experience | Research | Design | Prototype | Technology | Complexity_**

I like all of them.

> _Do you love to **solve complex design** problems?_

Yes. I'd extend the emphasis to **_solve complex design problems_**.
 
> _Are you excited about building **extraordinary UX**?_

Yes. I'd extend the emphasis to **_building extraordinary UX_**.

> Are you looking for teammates who appreciate open communication and face challenges together?

Yes. I'd highlight **_appreciate open communication_** for symmetry / balance.

> _Dynatrace is a **global leader** in **Software Intelligence** because **the world needs software to work perfectly**._ 

Please fix this.

> Due to our **high quality standards and cutting-edge technologies** we are proud to convince customers like H&M, Delta Airlines, SAP, United Health Care, JP Morgan and many others.

I like that. I'd adjust the emphasis to _**high quality standards** and **cutting-edge technologies**_.

> Own the complete UX lifecycle and collaborate closely with the UX core team

There is no _UX lifecycle_. While being part of the (another, non-core?) UX team?

> Do user tests, talk to customers, and work with analytics

Ok. _User tests_ means (manual) quality assurance?

> Produce information architectures and user flows

Ok. Output format?

> Create wireframes and story maps

Ok. Software?

> Build product design mocks (Sketch) and interactive click mocks (InVision)

Ah, ok. I'm not sure about *Sketch* as I'm not a Mac / macOS user (last use ~20 years ago).

> You think in information structures, data hierarchies, user flows and usability principles

I do? I don't think in colors, fonts, icons, margins, and borders though. Form follows function.

> You strive for visual clarity, simplicity, consistency, balance, and beauty

I do!

> You already built complex user interfaces

More or less.

> You know the basics of web frontend development

I do.

> You are a team player, problem solver, and proactive doer

I am.

> You like to completely immerse yourself in a single topic and solve it end-2-end

I do. _Solving something end-2-end_ means solving it on your own (alone)?

> You care to deliver high quality solutions, instead of half-hearted deliverables

I do.

> You want to work in an agile software environment based on a proven UX process

There is no *agile software environment* (in this context at least). Agile methodologies are not about (formal) processes. See the [Manifesto for Agile Software **Development**](https://agilemanifesto.org), which states

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

and 

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

So I'd like to work in an environment supporting agile software development, yes.

> Your want to learn from a large team of experienced designers

Yes!

> You like to conquer real challenges, instead of drawing generic e-commerce shops

Yes. I've never drawn _generic e-commerce shops_ though (have set up, skinned, populated with content, written a plug-in or two).

> You want to improve your skills and grow within your craft

Sure.
