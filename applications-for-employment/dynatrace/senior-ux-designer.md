## Motivational Letter

> Team: User Experience

A whole team!

> **User Experience | Research | Design | Prototype | Technology | Complexity**

Bought!

> Do you love to solve complex design problems? Are you excited about building extraordinary UX? Are you looking for teammates who appreciate open communication and face challenges together? 

Of course!

> Dynatrace is a global leader in Software Intelligence, because the world needs software to work perfectly. 

Please fix this.

> Our innovative SaaS product helps customers to get a self-driving IT. Due to our high quality standards and cutting-edge technologies we are proud to convince customers like H&M, Delta Airlines, SAP, United Health Care, JP Morgan, and many others. 

Hmkay.

> Our company was founded in Linz (Austria) 15 years ago, and currently counts more than 2.200 employees across several locations worldwide. In 2019 we opened a Lab in Graz as well. Our value creation teams in Graz focus on **Digital Business**, which is a combination of **platforms**, tools, and services to deliver an unrivaled, world-class customer lifecycle experience. With such digital services we get **deep insights** into the customer journey enabling us to offer proactive support, identify new **business opportunities**, drive operational excellence, and ultimately ensure **customer success**.

Sounds good.

> Your work will mainly focus on improving the end-to-end UX of some of our systems including licensing provisioning and management, **identity and access** management, as well as of a brand-new **customer experience portal**.

Hmkay.

> In close collaboration with product managers, software engineers, and other global designers you will strive for creating consistent and compelling experiences across those areas. 

Yes!


### Your role

> take ownership of the complete UX lifecycle for software licensing, identity & access, and CX portal

Duplication / reinforcement of the pre-previous sentence; _UX lifecycle_ sounds profound; partial ownership, I suppose (due _close collaboration_ with multiple parties).

> plan and perform UX research, collect and analyze data, and translate insights to inform your designs

> continuously partner with product managers, engineers, and other global experience design teams

> be as hands-on as needed to visualize and prototype design solutions (e.g. with IA, user flows, wireframes, mockups, UI, etc.)

### Your profile

> you have solid experience and a demonstrated track record of designing, shipping, and iterating on digital software products and systems — not just websites or campaigns. Big bonus if matured working on Enterprise Software as well

- Bobo

> you are fully comfortable and especially keen to work through business & design problems from beginning to end — e.g. planning and doing UX research, translating insights and data into concepts that form new products and features, designing detailed solutions to make things real, and continuously learning from and iterating upon what you ship

> you got plenty of experience successfully collaborating with multidisciplinary teams of product managers, engineers, designers, and other business stakeholders

### You will love and rock this job if

> you master both fine art & skills to effectively communicate and present your POVs and works across the board — you’ll use this daily to help people across the company understand the rationale behind your proposals, and the complex nuances of design problems 

- [niki]()

> you are not afraid of collaborating with geographically dispersed teams. While you’ll be part of an amazing global design team, you’ll be the first local UX design practitioner in Graz 

- [DIMDEX Organization](https://github.com/nikita-sharov/dimdex)
- [Pure Legacy](https://github.com/nikita-sharov/pure-legacy)

> you are a motivated self-starter — with a strong growth mindset, desire to humanize things, willing to own problems, with a balanced sense of optimism and humility, and at comfort with ambiguity

> When applying for this role please include a link to a brief portfolio showing a few selected commercial projects you worked on in the past — clearly outlining the problems and/or business opportunities taken on with your work, as well as your role and specific responsibilities as part of a multidisciplinary team. That should mostly touch on the process applied to find solutions and overcome challenges, rather than focusing just on visual polish and final deliverables.

The "KPIs" r as hilarious as vacuous [nichtssagend].

It's not an e-book, it's a marketing booklet (10 slides / pages).

Die Beschreibung ist wesentlich besser:

> _Who we are: Dynatrace is a **leading software product** company founded in Linz, Austria with more than 2,200 employees worldwide and we are operating out of Graz as well since 2019.  
Our vision: We believe the world needs software to work perfectly.  
What we do: **Software Intelligence to simplify enterprise **cloud complexity** and accelerate **digital transformation**. Our Value Creation Teams in Graz focuses on "**Digital Business**". Digital Business is a combination of platforms, tools and services to deliver an unrivaled, world-class customer lifecycle experience. With these **digital services** we get deep insights into the customer journey enabling us to offer proactive **support** and services, identify new business **opportunities**, drive operational excellence and ultimately ensure **customer success**._

_Digital Business_ `==` _combination of **platforms**, tools and services_ `==` _**digital services**_ oh, ok.

Wtf is _customer lifecycle experience_?!

_Application Performance_ (_Management_ [missing]) part of the sunburst diagram is missing _DevOps_.

Inconsistent title casing (see https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/ vs. https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/application-performance-management/)

Infrastructure Monitoring: Overview and Hosts/ VMs/ Containers share the same link (https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/infrastructure-monitoring/).

Digital Business Analytics: there is no real Transactions / Analytics / Conversations / Automation sections to link to https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/digital-business-analytics/#transactions

Den Texten wäre Automation ein professionelles (technisches) Lektorat zu empfehlen (top- / higher-navigation-level-level pages at least).

Man könnte auch die ganze selbstentwickelte (künstliche) Intelligence über den eigenen öffentlichen Web-Auftritt https://www.dynatrace.com/ laufen lassen (um es automatisiert zu optimieren).
