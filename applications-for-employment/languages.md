My English skills are basic in comparison to my German skills.

## English 

Skills in descending order by experience

1. Reading (documentation, code, technical journalism, professional literature, correspondence);
2. Writing (code, documentation, correspondence);
3. Listening (to multimedia content);
4. Speaking.

Please note, that I have not received any constructive feedback on my written English since school, therefore I can't guarantee flawless style and grammar.

I looks like my peers can understand me though.
