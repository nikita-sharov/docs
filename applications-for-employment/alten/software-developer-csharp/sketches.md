Make the most of the career opportunities we offer and convince yourself why ALTEN is the best employer for you.

Secure & Diverse

ALTEN offers the chance to work on versatile and appealing projects in many sectors and a wealth of new challenges that makes working with our clients both exciting and stimulating. We work in a wide range of different sectors; irrespective of whether our assignment is to develop a single component or to work on a project from design to serial production phase, in our technology centres and on-site with our clients – we always develop, program, simulate and test with passion. Here we attach great importance to developing a long-term partnership with our employees and customers, thus ensuring project progress. Therefore we guarantee every employee a permanent position to facilitate planning for the future.

Vibrant & Open

ALTEN employs highly qualified personnel of more than 50 nationalities at numerous locations in Germany. This represents a very real treasure trove of expertise and knowledge in a vast range of fields. ALTEN undertakes different assignments and a wide diversity of technical projects for more than 100 major manufacturers and first-tier suppliers working in all business sectors. We can achieve this through open doors, flat hierarchies and by treating each other fairly and correctly. We are all on familiar terms with each other, from trainee to top manager. All management staff are always ready to provide support to their personnel. Every individual is important and everyone is treated with respect and understanding.

Highly qualified employees. Exciting projects.

Appreciation

Maintaining work-life balance is very important to us – in good as much as in bad times. We offer our employees special vacation time for making significant changes in their private life, such as marriage, birth or adoption of a child, project-related relocation or loss of a close relative, and appreciate happy events such as wedding and offspring, with a little something. If special situations, such as care for a relative or child, require more time, it is possible to reduce the working hours temporarily or permanently in consultation with your manager or, where applicable, with your customer. Furthermore we are proud of our employees who are loyal to us. For that reason, we reward the long-term loyalty and the continued commitment of employees who have accrued jubilees based on services rendered at five-yearly intervals.

Benefits

Also we follow a performance-linked compensation system and offer you other financial benefits:

- ~~Supplementary health insurance~~
- ~~Company pension scheme~~
- Travel expenses and subsidised tax advice
- Provision [Versorgung] of the technical equipment needed for a project (e.g. laptop, phone)

Hardware and software

- ~~Personal company car and share options for managerial personnel~~ Not for me, right?
- ~~Exclusive purchase savings~~ ?
- ~~Etc.~~

Support & Commitment

I dont give a fuck about:

We work with people every day and are conscious of our social responsibility. We promote young talent in house and through sponsorship. We have been the training partner for various professional groups since the 1990s. We regularly award final theses and internships to students in order to combine the latest scientific developments with practice and support young professionals individually as they embark on their careers. We also provide support in the form of finance and expertise to Formula Student teams. ALTEN is an established partner of the teams of RWTH Aachen University (EcurieAix) and Ulm University of Applied Sciences (Einstein Motorsport). Beyond ALTEN’s working environment we also act with compassion in the event of disasters and to safeguard our environment and have been supporting charitable organisations and projects for many years with an annual Christmas donation.

Could you express this in numbers? How much of your revenue do you donate in percent? More than 0.1%? Whatever that exactly means in financial terms ... 2,624 (https://www.alten.at/en/company/about-us.html) for 2018 2,624M EUR?



Onboarding & Development

The first few days in a new job are always a challenge. A new environment, new colleagues, new processes and rules. Our Welcome booklet provides the most important information for starting at ALTEN and new employees get their own personal starter kit with the most important equipment they need. We endeavour to deploy and develop our employees according to their strengths. This applies both to the staffing of projects and our internal positions. Technical training is individually tailored to the needs of the next project or task. ALTEN employs an international team – so there are plenty of opportunities to take language courses. We are working to incorporate tailored initiatives already carried out into a standardised training and development programme which will be expanded. Our business managers are supported at each stage in their careers by a management programme especially set up by ALTEN.

Fun & Teamspirit

I don't give a fuck (about the "working climate" outside of working, ffs).

We lay emphasis on a good working climate and a strong spirit of solidarity. Regular events involving the team and the entire company are important, so that our employees get to know one another outside of the workplace context. The key focus during the annual summer festival is on building team spirit, on fun and play. Over Christmas, we organize festivities for our employees to bid goodbye to the old, and ring in the New Year. Even during the course of the year, managers and employees visit the beer garden or go bowling together. By supporting sporting events, our employees get active together and do more for their health. Often, we combine special events, such as soccer world championship, and special occasions, such as Christmas, with small sweepstakes. We are always trying to come up with new ideas – just wait and see!
