## Conservative application

Dear Mrs. Stankovic,

I am a highly-qualified, experienced and well-trained software developer with many years of experience, gaining in-depth domain knowledge and expert knowledge in any service area required. I support employers, colleagues, and clients from any industry sector throughout the software development process: I develop, design, program, document, test and manage software (projects) from the idea to the deployment and maintenance.

I offer a wide range of development services, which means: excellent prospects for your projects. My projects are always success- and future-oriented, and I always enrich the others, being highly enthusiastic and fascinated by technology on a daily basis…

Oh, let me talk about my imperfection then, to re-gain some credibility, turning the narrative upside down, trying to define me by demarcation from what I am not; so my limitations are:

- I have no domain knowledge of the semiconductor industry (yet).
- I have an incompleted technical education (University) in software development.
- My WPF / MVVM knowledge is more theoretical than practical.
- My English skills are basic in comparison to my German skills.

But at night … I am ~~bat~~ [hackerman](https://youtu.be/KEkrWRHCDQU?t=134). Believe me.

## Requires clarification

According to my superficial, quick search based understanding, [TCE](https://github.com/cpc/tce), in the semiconductor industry context,

> **TTA-based Co-Design Environment** (TCE) is an open application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) toolset for design and programming of customized co-processors (typically programmable accelerators). It is based on the energy efficient **Transport Triggered Architecture** (TTA) processor template.

being [written in C/C++](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acpc%2Ftce+language%3AC&type=Code),

> TCE has been developed by several researchers (and research assistants) of Tampere University (Finland) and various other international contributors since the early **2003**.

should be stable by now ([v1.21](https://github.com/cpc/tce/blob/master/tce/CHANGES)).
